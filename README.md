# vim

My personal vim configurations! 

Also, a personal public stash for all my notes of vimscripts along with sample plugins I am currently making.

List of projects under development/soon to be developed
1) Personal comments 
  - Inspired by ansible, a simple way to toggle on/off comments on existing file without changing the actual file
2) Custom Vim template/compiler of all files
  - A custom vim template, the main feature is to compile all the files into one file by given topic/subject or tags.
